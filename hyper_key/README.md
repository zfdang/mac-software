# Create hyper key for your MBP

## Why Hyper key
> [Hyper Key](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/#hyper)

The problem in defining new keyboard shortcuts is that you want to make them relatively easy to type while not conflicting with shortcuts already defined

Hyper Key: holding Control, Command, Option and Shift all at once. 

Rarely is this combination used as a hotkey combo, so it becomes a key that can be mapped to system-wide functions that are easily accessible without conflicting with anything else.
