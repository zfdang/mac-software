# Lock or Sleep Only Your Mac’s Screen

To lock your Mac’s screen, simultaneously press the following keys: 
Control + Shift + Eject. If you have a newer Mac that doesn’t have an optical drive (and thus has no eject key on the keyboard, such as the Retina MacBook Pro), the command is 


> Control + Shift + Power

In both cases, you’ll see your Mac’s display shut off immediately, while the system continues to run in the background.
